<section>
<h2 class="wb-inv">2. Using your MSCA</h2>



<p>You can find information on how to use the following programs:</p>	

<details>
<summary><h3>Employment Insurance (EI) information</h3></summary>

<section>
    <h4 id="a1-1">Updating EI information in My Service Canada Account</h4>
    <p>When you change your mailing address or direct deposit information using My Service Canada Account, it is updated immediately.</p>
    <p>Payment information is updated the next business day once your report is processed. Processing normally occurs early evenings, Sunday through Thursday. Reports submitted before the processing time will be displayed in “View my payment information” the following business day. Therefore, if you file your report from Sunday to Thursday before our processing time, your payment information will be updated in “View my payment information” the next business day. However, if you file your report on Friday or Saturday, your payment information will appear on Monday.</p>
    <p>Please note that statutory holidays can affect our processing schedule. Check under “<strong>Messages</strong>” on the My Service Canada Account home page for situations that may affect your payment.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4>“View my status and correspondence” </h4>
  <p>This link allows you to view messages and status  information specific to your latest EI claim or past claims. Information is  only available for EI claims filed after November 7, 2016.</p> </section>
    <section>
    <h4>Alert Me</h4>
  <p>The Alert Me feature is an optional notification service that sends an email to alert you when important new Employment Insurance (EI) claim information is available in your My Service Canada Account.</p>
  <p>To register for Alert you must first have a My Service Canada Account (MSCA), as well as a valid email address. The “Register for Alert Me” link is available from the left-hand navigation menu on the “View my status and correspondence” and “View my past claims messages” pages within MSCA.</p>
<p>Alert Me emails are very generic and simply prompt you to log in to MSCA because you have new important EI claim information available. A maximum of one email alert is sent in a 24 hour period.</p>
<p>You can unsubscribe at any time by selecting “Unsubscribe from Alert Me” link on the “Manage my Alert Me profile” page, which is available from the left-hand navigation menu in “View my status and correspondence” or “View my past claim messages”.</p>
<p>As soon as you complete the unsubscribe process, a confirmation message is displayed and you will no longer receive email alerts. You can subscribe again to Alert Me at any time.</p>
   </section>
  <section>
    <h4 id="a1-2">Information in “View my latest claim”</h4>
    <p>My Service Canada Account displays the information related to your current claim for EI benefits including the date it started, your benefit rate, the types of benefits paid and the number of weeks paid.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4 id="a1-3">Viewing previous EI claim information on the “View my past claims” page</h4>
    <p>This page displays a list of your past EI claims. Choosing a particular claim will provide you with a summary of information related to that claim. We periodically remove old claim information from our system, usually after a seven year period. You may not be able to see past claim information if it is no longer on our system.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4 id="a1-4">Change mailing address and / or telephone number</h4>
    <p>If you are an Employment Insurance claimant or have received EI benefits in the past year, you must let us know when you move and provide us with your new mailing address. This ensures that you do not experience undue delays in receiving benefits when they are payable and also ensures that we mail your T4E to the correct address for your tax return in the following year.  To change your mailing address and/or telephone number, sign in to My Service Canada Account and select the “View / change my mailing address and telephone number” option under the “Change” tab. You will see the mailing address that is currently on your file. Select the “Change” button to update the necessary information.</p>
